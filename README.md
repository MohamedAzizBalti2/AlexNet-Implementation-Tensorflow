# AlexNet with Response Normalization

This repository contains an implementation of the AlexNet architecture with Response Normalization using TensorFlow/Keras.

## Overview

The AlexNet model is a convolutional neural network architecture that won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) in 2012. It consists of five convolutional layers followed by three fully connected layers, with ReLU activation functions used throughout the network.

This implementation incorporates Response Normalization layers after the first, second, and last convolutional layers, as described in the original AlexNet paper by Krizhevsky et al.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- TensorFlow Datasets (for loading datasets)
- NumPy (for data manipulation)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/alexnet-with-response-normalization.git
